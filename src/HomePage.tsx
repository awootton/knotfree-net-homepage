      Knotfree is a tool for creating Internet Of Things applications.<br></br><br></br>
      The main idea is to create a thing, which is a device that can be controlled by a user. Like a thermometer, doorbell, light or an electronic device of your creation.<br></br><br></br>
      The dashboard is a place to see and control your things. It is the 'Things' tab (press the â˜° in the upper left).<br></br>
      <br></br>
      {isEmpty &&
        <div className="indented">
          Since it seems you are new here we can help you get started:<br></br>
          <button className='homepage' onClick={addAThing}>Click here to have a 'thing' set up for you.</button><br></br><br></br>
         Use the menu button,â˜° on the upper right and use Pick Command to select different commands and press the button to see what they do.<br></br>
         It would be less boring if it was your own thing ðŸ˜Š. <br></br><br></br>
        </div>
      }
    
      If you are here to get a token for a thing that you are initializing, <button className='homepage' onClick={() => {registry.PublishChange("VerticalTabs",1)}
         }>you can get one here.</button><br></br>
